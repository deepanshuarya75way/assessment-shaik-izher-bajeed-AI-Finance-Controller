    <strong>🚀 Live Demo — AI Finance Controller</strong>
  </a>
</p>

AI Finance Controller is an intelligent financial operations system designed to detect reconciliation exceptions, investigate them using AI, assess risk, and safely manage financial actions through a human-in-the-loop approval workflow.

The project focuses on a key principle for financial automation:

> **AI can assist financial decision-making, but sensitive financial actions should remain controlled, auditable, and verifiable.**

---

## 📌 Overview

Modern payment and financial systems process large volumes of transactions, payments, invoices, and settlements. Identifying discrepancies and investigating financial exceptions manually can be time-consuming and operationally expensive.

**AI Finance Controller** provides an end-to-end workflow for managing these exceptions.

The system combines deterministic financial reconciliation with AI-assisted investigation and controlled automation to transform raw financial discrepancies into structured, actionable workflows.

### Core Capabilities

- Automated financial reconciliation
- Exception detection and classification
- AI-powered investigation
- Financial context analysis
- Risk-based decision making
- Human-in-the-loop approval
- Controlled action execution
- Sandbox-based financial operations
- Automatic execution verification
- Financial analytics and operational monitoring

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Financial operations teams frequently need to investigate issues such as:

- Missing settlements
- Payment mismatches
- Invoice differences
- Settlement delays
- Transaction discrepancies
- Reconciliation exceptions

A typical investigation may require manually identifying related records, analyzing financial evidence, determining the likely cause, deciding on the next action, obtaining approval, and verifying the final result.

As transaction volume increases, this workflow becomes increasingly repetitive and difficult to manage efficiently.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to build an intelligent financial controller that can automate the investigation and workflow management process while maintaining appropriate controls over sensitive financial actions.

---

# 💡 Our Approach

The project follows a **controlled AI-assisted financial operations architecture**.

Instead of allowing an AI model to directly perform financial operations, the system separates intelligence, decision-making, approval, execution, and verification into independent stages.

    Financial Data
          ↓
    Validation & Normalization
          ↓
    Reconciliation Engine
          ↓
    Exception Detection
          ↓
    AI Investigation
          ↓
    Risk Assessment
          ↓
    Controller Decision
          ↓
    Human Approval
          ↓
    Controlled Execution
          ↓
    Automatic Verification

This architecture ensures that AI acts as an **investigation and recommendation layer**, while sensitive actions remain protected by deterministic controls and approval mechanisms.

---

# ⭐ Key Features

## 1. Financial Reconciliation

The reconciliation engine compares related financial records and identifies inconsistencies across payments, invoices, settlements, and transactions.

The system can detect financial issues such as:

- Missing settlements
- Payment discrepancies
- Invoice differences
- Settlement mismatches
- Delayed settlements

Detected issues are converted into structured exceptions that can be tracked throughout the workflow.

---

## 2. AI-Powered Investigation

The AI investigation layer analyzes the available financial context associated with an exception.

It generates structured insights including:

- Investigation summary
- Likely cause
- Recommended action
- Risk-related information

This allows financial exceptions to move from simple discrepancy detection toward contextual investigation and actionable recommendations.

---

## 3. Risk-Based Controller

The controller evaluates each exception and determines the appropriate workflow.

The decision process considers information such as:

- Exception severity
- Financial risk
- Controller priority
- Proposed action
- Approval requirements
- Execution permissions

This creates a controlled separation between **AI recommendations** and **actual financial actions**.

---

## 4. Human-in-the-Loop Approval

Sensitive actions are protected through an approval workflow.

Actions that require review cannot proceed directly to execution.

The workflow supports controlled states such as:

    PENDING_APPROVAL
            ↓
        APPROVED
            ↓
    EXECUTION_ALLOWED

This ensures that important financial actions remain under human supervision.

---

## 5. Controlled Sandbox Execution

Approved actions are executed through a dedicated Finance Sandbox environment.

The sandbox simulates controlled financial operations without interacting with real financial systems.

This allows the complete automation workflow to be tested safely, including:

- Action execution
- Settlement verification
- Execution responses
- Failure handling
- Workflow state updates

---

## 6. Automatic Verification

Execution is not considered complete simply because an action request succeeds.

The system verifies the execution result and updates the workflow accordingly.

A successful controlled workflow follows:

    PENDING_APPROVAL
            ↓
        APPROVED
            ↓
    SANDBOX_EXECUTED
            ↓
    SANDBOX_VERIFIED

This provides a clear and traceable lifecycle for financial actions.

---

# 🔄 End-to-End Workflow

    1. Financial records enter the system
                ↓
    2. Data is validated and normalized
                ↓
    3. Reconciliation engine compares related records
                ↓
    4. Financial discrepancies are detected
                ↓
    5. Exceptions are created and classified
                ↓
    6. AI investigates the financial context
                ↓
    7. Controller evaluates risk and proposes an action
                ↓
    8. Sensitive actions require human approval
                ↓
    9. Approved actions are executed in a controlled sandbox
                ↓
    10. Execution results are automatically verified

# 🔐 Safety and Control Model

Financial automation requires stronger controls than ordinary application automation.

This project separates the workflow into distinct layers:

    AI Intelligence
          ↓
    Recommendation
          ↓
    Risk Assessment
          ↓
    Controller Decision
          ↓
    Human Approval
          ↓
    Controlled Execution
          ↓
    Verification

The AI model does not receive unrestricted authority to independently perform sensitive financial operations.

The system uses:

- Risk-based controls
- Approval requirements
- Human review
- Controlled execution
- Execution verification
- Clear workflow states
- Sandbox-based testing

This architecture makes the system more suitable for exploring AI-assisted workflows in financial operations.

---

# 🧠 Why This Architecture?

A financial AI system should not simply follow the pattern:

    AI → Decision → Execute

Instead, this project implements:

    AI Investigation
          ↓
    Recommendation
          ↓
    Deterministic Controller
          ↓
    Risk Controls
          ↓
    Human Approval
          ↓
    Controlled Execution
          ↓
    Verification

This separation provides better control, traceability, and safety when applying AI to financial workflows.

The architecture is designed around the principle that **AI should assist financial operations rather than receive unrestricted authority over sensitive actions**.

# 🔎 Key Design Principles

### AI-Assisted, Not AI-Unrestricted

AI is used for investigation, analysis, and recommendations rather than unrestricted financial execution.

### Human Oversight

Sensitive actions can require human approval before execution.

### Deterministic Controls

Critical workflow decisions are separated from probabilistic AI output.

### Controlled Execution

Financial operations are performed through a sandbox environment rather than directly against real financial systems.

### Verification

Execution results are verified before the workflow is considered complete.

### Traceability

Workflow states provide a clear lifecycle from exception detection to investigation, approval, execution, and verification.
